# WELCOME TO THE PROJECT 3 REAMDME

Project Goals

#Overview of Project:

#Our project is a Mom Blog that allows moms to connect with one another to meet up, ask questions and share any sales on things such as food, clothes, baby food, etc. The following are the main features that will be added or are planned for 
future implementation

1. Centralized Blog section on the landing page for content writers to post their blog posts. (will need to 
have a profile and be logged in to post)

2. Questions Section for anyone and everyone to post questions they may have about anything mom related 
(this will be like a forum).

3. Meet Up Section for moms to go and set up playdates or coffee dates, etc.

4. Current sales/deals Section to allow for moms to post current sales/deals on groceries, kid supplies, 
clothes, etc.

5. Personal blog profiles - This will be a place that moms can create their profile and post their blogs on their
own profile page and gives them the ability to favorite anything of the blog posts on the main page and or
questions section, sales section, and meet up sections. (They can also link their blog to the main blog thread 
or leave all their posts on their own profile)
